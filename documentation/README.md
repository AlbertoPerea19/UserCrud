# User Management System Architecture and TDD Approach Report

## Application Architecture Overview

The User Management System is a web application built with PHP/Laravel for the backend and Vue.js with Vuetify for the frontend. Let's break down the architecture and key components:

### Backend Architecture:

- **Models:** Represent database tables and handle data manipulation.
- **Controllers:** Handle incoming requests, process data, and send responses.
- **Routes:** Define endpoints for API routes.
- **Middleware:** Implement JWT authentication for securing routes.
- **Services:** Implement business logic separate from controllers.
- **Providers:** Register application services and dependencies.
- **Database:** Utilizes MySQL or SQLite for data storage.

### Frontend Architecture:

- **Components:** Reusable UI elements built with Vue.js.
- **Views:** Templates rendered by Vue.js components.
- **Router:** Handles frontend routing for different pages.
- **API Service:** Facilitates communication with backend APIs.
- **Authentication:** Implements JWT-based authentication for user sessions.

## Key Decisions Made During Development

### 1. Technology Stack Selection:

- Laravel was chosen for its robustness, extensive documentation, and strong community support.
- Vue.js with Vuetify was selected for the frontend due to its flexibility, component-based architecture, and rich UI elements.

### 2. Authentication Mechanism:

- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) was implemented for secure authentication to manage user sessions.
- This choice provides stateless authentication, scalability, and ease of integration with APIs.

### 3. Testing Strategy:

- TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach was followed throughout development.
- PHPUnit was used for backend testing to ensure API endpoints function correctly.
- Frontend interactions were tested using Jest and Vue Test Utils to maintain code quality and functionality.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Implementation

TDD principles were integrated into the development process to ensure code quality, functionality, and maintainability. Let's review the tests conducted for the backend:

1. **Create User Test:**
   - Validates the creation of a new user with valid data.
   - Verifies that the user is properly stored in the database.
   - Checks if the password is hashed correctly.

2. **Validation Error Test:**
   - Ensures that the API returns a validation error when invalid data is provided.

3. **Authentication Test:**
   - Registers a new user and then tests if the authentication endpoint returns a JWT token.

4. **Update User Test:**
   - Creates a user, updates their information, and verifies the changes in the database.

5. **Delete User Test:**
   - Creates a user and then tests the deletion of that user.

6. **List Users Test:**
   - Checks if the API endpoint returns a list of users.

7. **Update User with Incomplete Data Test:**
   - Tests that the API returns a validation error when trying to update a user with incomplete data.
